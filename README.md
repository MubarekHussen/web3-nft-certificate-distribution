# Project Name: Web3 DApp for NFT Certificates and Smart Contracts

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end Web3 decentralized application (DApp) leveraging Algorand Blockchain to generate, distribute, and manage Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as certificates for trainees. The DApp facilitates the issuance and verification of certificates by staff members, trainees' opt-in process, and potential integration of smart contract functionalities for additional actions.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the codebase for a comprehensive Web3 DApp. It includes modules for personalized certificate generation, API connections to Algorand Blockchain, frontend and backend development, testing setups, wallet integration, NFT creation adhering to ARC3 standards, and potential smart contract implementation.
